This projects aims at scraping the data from google maps and linkedin .It gathers the company name , their address, phone number, website url and the department to which the company belongs, they are all obtained from google maps. Coming to the linkedin code it extracts all the people who belong to the companies which we preprocess and fetched the names. All the names might not be fetched with 100% accuracy as we need to either have followed them or have  premium subscription to get their names and the role they play in the company.
